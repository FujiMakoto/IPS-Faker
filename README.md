# Faker
Faker is a 3rd party IPS application. It provides developers and theme designers with a means of quickly and easily generating fake (boilerplate) content on their development installations.

This application is currently in pre-release status. It is currently limited generating member accounts and forum topics at the moment, but I plan on offering a means of easily extending the application so that it can be used to generate boilerplate content on custom third party applications in the future.
